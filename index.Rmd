### Filters

Where

```{r}
bscols(
  filter_select(
    id = "la",
    label = "Local Authority",
    sharedData = dvc_sd,
    group = ~localautho
  ),
  filter_select(
    id = "road",
    label = "Road",
    sharedData = dvc_sd,
    group = ~road_no
  )
)
```

When

```{r}
bscols(
  filter_select(
    id = "year",
    label = "Year",
    sharedData = dvc_sd,
    group = ~year
  ),
  filter_select(
    id = "month",
    label = "Month",
    sharedData = dvc_sd,
    group = ~inc_month
  )
)
```

What

```{r}
filter_select(
  id = "species",
  label = "Deer species",
  sharedData = dvc_sd,
  group = ~deer_speci
)
```

### Interactive table

```{r}

    extensions = c(

### How to use

#### Filters

You can:

* select one or more local authorities from the dropdown menu (remove them with your backspace key)
* select one or more Ofsted grades using the checkboxes
* select the phase of education with the checkboxes
* drag the slider to select a pupil count
* drag the slider to filter by the percenatge of pupils receiving free school meals

#### Interactive map

You can:

* click to grab and drag the map around
* zoom with the '+' and '--' buttons (top-left) or with your mouse's scroll wheel
* click a marker to reveal a popup with information about that school
* click the button showing a broken square (top-left under the zoom options) to select points on the map using a window that's draggable (click and hold the grid icon in the upper left) and resizeable (click and drag the white boxes in each corner)

#### Interactive table

You can:

* filter each column by typing in the boxes under each column header
* sort the columns (ascending and descending) by clicking on the column header
* change which columns are visible by clicking the Column visibility button
* click 'CSV' or 'Excel' to download the filtered data to a .csv file or a .xlsx
* see how many entries remain after filtering in the bottom-left, where it says 'Showing X to Y of Z entries'

### Notes

#### Under construction

This tool is under construction. Functionality is missing. The data are just a sample of the original dataset. This will be the case while the tool is in development.

#### Tools

[R v3.5.1](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio v1.1.463](https://www.rstudio.com/) were used.

Packages used were

* [Flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) to create a frame for the content
* [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) for the interactive map
* [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) for the interactive table
* [Crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) for widget interactivity
* TODO: add more

The code for this tool is available from [github.com/matt-dray/scot-deer-collision](https://github.com/matt-dray/scot-deer-collision).
