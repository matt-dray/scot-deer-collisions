# Deer-vehicle collisions in Scotland, 2000 to 2017

Under development.

A small app for exploring traffic accidents involving deer.

There are two tools here:

1. A Crosstalk app for 2017 data only. Intended as a small test. [The demo is live here](https://matt-dray.github.io/scot-deer-collisions/). Please give it a few moments to load; Crosstalk renders all points in the browser. The 'Information' tab is not very useful at this point.
1. A Shiny app for all the data from 2000 to 2017. This isn't possible using Crosstakl because there are too many points to render in-browser.
