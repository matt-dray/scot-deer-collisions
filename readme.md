# Deer-vehicle collisions in Scotland, 2000 to 2017

Under development.

A small app for exploring traffic accidents in Scotland involving deer.

(There's also a secret test Crosstalk app for 2017 data only. Intended as a small test. [The demo is live here](https://matt-dray.github.io/scot-deer-collisions/). Please give it a few moments to load; Crosstalk renders all points in the browser.)
